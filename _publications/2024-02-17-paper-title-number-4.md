**Abstract**: Amidst the increasingly prevalent smartphone addiction, we introduce StayFocused, a mobile app to help people focus on their tasks at hand by reducing compulsive smartphone use. Besides guiding people to set focus sessions for non-screen time, we incorporated reflective prompts probing individualsâ€™ phone-checking intentions whenever they check their phones and a chatbot to deliver these prompts. To examine the effects of the reflective prompts and the chatbot support, we designed three versions of StayFocused: baseline, reflection, and reflection-chatbot, and conducted a stage-based between-subjects study with 36 college students over five weeks. We found that participants who received the reflective prompts were able to focus longer and resist distractions, and those with chatbot support seemed to better maintain their smartphone use reduction. By highlighting how participants reflected on their focus session activities and their preferences for the chatbot, we discuss the implications of designing persuasive conversational interfaces to reduce unintended behaviors.
