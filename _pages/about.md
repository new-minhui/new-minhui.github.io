I am currently a Ph.D. candidate major in computer science at BiWell Lab, City University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Dr. Yuhan LUO](https://yuhanlolo.github.io/me/).

Before working at HongKong, I spent four years (2019 to 2023) at Xi'an Jiaotong University for my bachelor's degree in Automation. Currently, my research area is human-computer interaction, I read literature, conducted interview or co-design sessions to understand people's needs and derive design rationales; I built prototypes (usually include LLM-powered conversational interfaces) to investigate if my design could help optimize user experience and promote well-being in real-world scenarios.

**Key words of my research: human-AI interaction, well-being, persuasive technology, conversational agent/interface**.
