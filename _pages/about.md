I am currently a Ph.D. candidate major in computer science at BiWell Lab, City University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Dr. Yuhan LUO](https://yuhanlolo.github.io/me/).

Before working at HongKong, I spent four years (2019 to 2023) at Xi'an Jiaotong University, where I earned my bachelor's degree in Automation. Currently, my research focuses on human-computer interaction. I review literature, conduct interviews, and facilitate co-design sessions to understand users' needs and develop design rationales. Following that, I build prototypes, often featuring LLM-powered conversational interfaces, to explore whether my designs can enhance user experience and promote well-being in real-world scenarios.

**Key words of my research: human-AI interaction, well-being, persuasive technology, conversational agent/interface**.
